# Job-Portal
Created by Vince Chang

Backbone.Js project that displays a job portal. There are two jobs to choose
from: Front End Engineer and a UI Architect. I am using Handlebars as a template
to display any number of jobs which have a job title and job description.
Backbone logic is implemented to display HTML/CSS/JS. Once the user clicks on
the finished button, they will see an alert with the information they had filled
out!
